# personal-website with Symfony 4

First website with Symfony 4

Learning the basic usage of:
- annotations (wildcards, requirements)
- custom error pages(visible only on PROD env)
- debug
- logger
- twig (loops, filters)
- forms

To test the custom error pages in your local machine, please update the APP_ENV attribute under .env file to prod.
